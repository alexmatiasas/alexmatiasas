# 👋 Hi, I'm Alejandro Matías — Physicist turned Data Scientist & ML Engineer

I’m a **Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics** now working as a **Data Scientist** with a strong focus on **Machine Learning**, **NLP**, and **MLOps**. My background in mathematical modeling and scientific computing allows me to approach data problems with a deep, analytical mindset — from physical simulations to large-scale ML systems.

I enjoy building **real-world, production-ready ML solutions**: from idea to deployment.

---

## 🔧 What I do

- ✅ Develop end-to-end ML pipelines using **Python**, **FastAPI**, **Docker**, and **CI/CD**
- 📊 Perform in-depth **EDA and feature engineering** using **pandas**, **numpy**, and **matplotlib**
- 🧠 Build models for **recommendation systems**, **fraud detection**, **time series forecasting**, and **sentiment analysis**
- 🌐 Create interactive dashboards and REST APIs for model deployment
- 🧪 Combine scientific and ML approaches — e.g. simulations, PINNs, chaos/stochastic modeling (in Julia/Fortran)
