# Hi, I'm Alejandro Mat√≠as ‚Äî Physicist turned Data Scientist

I'm a physicist with a Ph.D. in theoretical particle physics, now transitioning into data science with a strong focus on NLP, machine learning, and statistical modeling. I enjoy solving complex problems, visualizing insights, and building meaningful tools powered by data.

### üîç What I do

- Build data pipelines and exploratory analyses in **Python** and **R**
- Work with NLP tasks: tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, n-gram models
- Develop machine learning models using **scikit-learn**, exploring **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**
- Simulate physical systems using **finite elements**, **symbolic math**, and **scientific computing**
- Document everything in **Jupyter** and **RMarkdown**, with reproducibility as a priority
